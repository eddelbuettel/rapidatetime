Description: Access to the C-level R date and 'datetime' code is provided for
 C-level API use by other packages via registration of native functions.
 Client packages simply include a single header 'RApiDatetime.h' provided
 by this package, and also 'import' it.  The R Core group is the original
 author of the code made available with slight modifications by this package.
